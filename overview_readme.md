###### PROJECTS
Ensure visibility of your team’s work by organizing code, data, and outputs into projects. Centralize knowledge, invite collaborators, and do work that is focused on solving the problems that impact your organization.


###### ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT
Focus on analysis, not configuration. Use Docker containers to set up repeatable, standardized environments for your team’s favorite open source tools, from notebooks to machine learning libraries.

###### LOCAL WORKFLOWS
Code in your favorite code editor and run in the DataScience Cloud. Seamlessly transition from your laptop to the platform and back again to bring prototypes to life faster.

###### ELASTIC INFRASTRUCTURE
Launch your code on servers that are ready to meet the demands of your analysis. The DataScience Cloud removes the barrier of big data analysis.

###### REPORTS
Turn Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown documents, and other files from your project into reproducible reports that can be shared across your organization.

###### VERSION CONTROL
Version your shared code and watch your projects progress. Track decisions, milestones, and project lineage over time, and never lose sight of your work again.

###### APIS
Deploy Python, R, or Spark code behind a REST API to make it instantly available for integration with real-time applications or dashboards.

###### SCHEDULED JOBS
Run code on a schedule to automate data science processes like data cleaning and model retraining.
